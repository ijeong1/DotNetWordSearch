# Developer Challenge: Word Finder

## Objective 
The objective of this challenge is not necessarily just to solve the problem but to
evaluate your software development skills, code quality, analysis, creativity, and resourcefulness
as a potential future colleague. Please share the necessary artifacts you would provide to your
colleagues in a real-world professional setting to best evaluate your work.

## Performance Analysis
### Time Complexity
* Constructor: O(R × C) where R is rows and C is columns
* Find method: O(W × (R + C)) where W is unique words in wordstream
* Space Complexity: O(R × C) for storing preprocessed words

### Optimizations
* Pre-processing: Matrix is processed once during construction to create horizontal and vertical word lists
* HashSet usage: O(1) lookups for word storage
* LINQ optimization: Distinct() removes duplicates early in the pipeline
* StringBuilder: Efficient string concatenation for vertical words

### Resource Usages
* Minimal memory allocation during searches
* No redundant string operations
* Efficient use of .NET collections

## Design Decisions
### Interface
* Simple, Clean public interface as specified
* Clear exception handling for invalid inputs
* Immutable intenal state for thread safety

### Error Handling
* Validates matrix dimensions
* Checks for null/empty inputs
* Consistent row lengths verification

### Code Organizations
* Clean separation of concerns
* Well-documented public method

## Potential Imrpovments
### Unit Tests
* Add Comprehensive unit tests

### Performance
* Implement parallel processing for large wordstreams
* Add caching for fre  uently searched word
* Consider using Span<T> for moden .NET version

### Features 
* Support for diagonal word search
* Case-insensitive search option

### Scalability
* Stream processing for large wordstreams
* Memory-mapped files for huge matrices
* Disributed processing support
